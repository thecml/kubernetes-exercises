\section{Background}

Much to people's surprise, the fortune cookie is not a Chinese invention, but an American fancy originating in California. It is often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States and other Western countries.

\section{Problem formulation}

In this exercise you'll get a chance to offer people an infinite amount of fortune cookies by just clicking a button. You'll use Kubernetes to create a backend service that'll return a fortune cookie upon request. You can store these cookies in memory, in a file you include in your Dockerfile or on the Internet. If you need some cookies, look in Appendix A. The website can be a simple HTML page, some CSS styling and a bit of JavaScript that fetches a cookie from your API whenever the user presses a button.

Formally, your solution should contain at least:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A deployment specification that supports multiple pods and has resources enabled.
	\item A service that can forward HTTP calls to your pods. 
	\item A website with some visualization of the cookie text and a way to get more (see figure \ref{fig:fortunecookie}).
\end{itemize}

Also, you must conduct the following experiments and support your findings with measurements and your own arguments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Run a load test towards your Kubernetes service with a different number of active replica pods, for example 2, 5, and 10, and write down your results. You can use PowerShell or NodeJS to make a simple loop that sends a lot of HTTP requests rapidly to your endpoint. Do you notice any lag? Does response times improve when you add more pods? Why or why not?
	\item With memory and CPU resources enabled for pods, experiment with various settings. What happens if you set the CPU resources very low? What happens if a container exceeds its memory limit? Document your findings.
\end{itemize}

For help with resources, see: \\ \url{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/}
